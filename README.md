# The No Hit (Heartless) challenge pack

This datapack implements the Minecraft challenge of playing without health.

Shields still block hits, but any hits that you take will instantly kill you. This means golden apples do not provide absorption, resistance doesn't help, poison kills and totems of undying does nothing.

Can also be paired with the [Heartless resource pack](https://github.com/slicedlime/Heartless) for a nicer display of the heartless heart.
